# Inverted-Index-Information-Retrieval-Project
Java code to create inverted index and allow for single or multi-term searches of a list of locally stored documents.

This code is meant to be run from the commmand line. SearchIndex contains the main method. -h will display what the input format should be to search. By default the list of documents should be in a folder titled Corpus in the same directory as the .class files, but another directory can be inputted manually.
